Each team must have a minimum of 3 participating houses. And all team members should be on the same street (this is all about getting to know your neighbors, after all!)

Houses should be decorated by December 4th

Community voting will take place December 5th-December 22nd (via SurveyMonkey)

Participating houses agree to have their holiday light photos shared among the neighborhood and Meadow Brook Elementary Facebook pages
